        I started programming when I was thirteen years old (2004). After
        graduating with a Bachelor's specialised in Information and
        Communications Technology (ICT) from

          >ORT Argentina Technical College</a
        >, I founded a software agency that grew to employ fifteen people.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later on, I carried my experience and willingness to keep growing to
        multiple organisations where I played roles as an engineering manager,
        technical leader, and software engineer. I also benefited from exploring
        my other passion, education, where I worked as a teacher and a content
        creator in programming related fields.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a professional, my focus is on delivering customer value by building
        healthy and dependable teams where the people and the systems they
        produce have clear growth opportunities. I leverage my inclusive
        leadership skills with +15 years of expertise in agile full-stack
        software development.
