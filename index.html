      <p>
        I've been a programmer for as long as I can remember, and in doing so, I
        was lucky enough to find my other passion, helping people grow in this
        industry. This combination led me to found a software agency that grew
        to employ fifteen people, to have the pleasure of working as a teacher
        at the college where I studied and to work as a software engineer and a
        manager in multiple organisations.
      </p>

      <p>
        As a professional, I focus on delivering customer value by developing
        healthy and accountable teams where the people and the systems they
        produce have clear growth opportunities. I leverage my inclusive
        leadership skills with +15 years of expertise in agile full-stack
        software development.
